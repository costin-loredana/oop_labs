The history of tea in Tibet dates back to the 7th century during the Tang dynasty. However, butter tea did not 
become popular in Tibet until about the 13th century, the time of the Phagmodrupa dynasty.
According to legend, a Chinese princess married a king of Tibet which later helped establish trade routes 
between China and Tibet. These trade routes brought tea into Tibet from China. Later, butter was added to 
the tea that was brought from China as butter is and was a staple in Tibetan cuisine.
By the 8th century, it was common to drink tea in Tibet. In the 13th century, tea was then used in Tibetan 
religious ceremonies. Today, butter tea is still prevalent in Tibet, and Tibetans can drink up to 60 small cups of the 
tea every day.
