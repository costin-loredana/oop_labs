The highest quality of butter tea is made by boiling pu-erh tea leaves in water for half a day, achieving a dark brown color. 
It is then skimmed, and poured into a cylinder with fresh yak butter and salt which is then shaken. The result is a liquid 
that is about the thickness of a stew or thick oil. It is then poured into teapots or jars.
Another method is to boil water and add handfuls of the tea into the water, which is allowed to steep until it turns almost 
black. Salt is then added, along with a little soda if wanted. The tea is then strained through a horse-hair or reed colander 
into a wooden butter churn, and a large lump of butter is added. This is then churned until the tea reaches the proper 
consistency and transferred to copper pots that sit on a brazier to keep them warm. When a churn is not available, a wooden 
bowl and rapid stirring will suffice. Each teapot and cup symbolize the standard of living of each family. A 
ceramic pot is the most widely used, while those made from copper or bronze may be used by families with a higher standard of living.
In the Ganden Monastery in Lhasa, Tibet, they[who?] prepare food for around 2,500 monks. During this, they prepare this traditional tea in large cauldrons and kettles. Each night, they boil the water, and the tea itself contains around sixteen bricks of the tea and hundreds of kilograms of butter. Each step comes with its own prayer. Once the tea is ready, one monk sounds the gong to let others know the tea is ready.
